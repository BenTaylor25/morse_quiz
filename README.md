# Morse Test

Simple Python quiz for Morse Code characters.

This quiz currently only has letters, but I may add numbers and punctuation later.

Requires colorama to work out of the box. <br>
If you don't have it installed already, open your terminal and run `pip install colorama`. <br>
If this didn't work, you may need to add Python to PATH.
